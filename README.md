## 🛠 Technologies Used

* CSS

## How It Works

When the toggle input changes:

1. JavaScript checks whether it is checked or not
2. The background color updates accordingly
3. The selected mode is saved in localStorage
4. On page load, the saved value is read and applied automatically

## Why This Project Matters

Even though this project is small, it covers important real-world concepts like:

* DOM manipulation
* Event handling
* Persistent data storage

It helped me move from theory to practical understanding.
